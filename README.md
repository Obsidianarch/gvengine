TODO: Any or all of this

I promise, I will eventually (I say that a lot) get started on this.  Finishing it is a completely different story.

In the meantime, the doc/ directory has resources (all OpenOffice Drawings, not sure what the Microsoft Office equivalent is) explaining parts of the engine that may not make a lot of sense (I make them before I create the code, so I decided why not let other people see it?).
